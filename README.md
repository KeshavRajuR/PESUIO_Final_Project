# PESUIO_Final_Project
This repository contains my final project for the course of Art of Efficient Programming(PESUIO).

The file named "client.c" is the driver file for the program.
The file named "header.c" is the interface file for the program.
The file named "algorithms.c" is the file containing the algorithms.

Terminal commands to run the program:
gcc -c client.c
gcc -c algorithms.c
gcc client.o algorithms.o
./a.out
